# Implementation Summary

## Request
This feature adds a 1/10 chance to post a random cat picture from a public API instead of the currently playing Spotify track. This will involve modifying the main script to integrate with a cat picture API and adding a random number generator to determine when to post the cat picture.

## Changes Made


### Files Modified
- `main.py`

## Implementation Steps
1. Step 1: Analyze `main.py` to understand how the Spotify track information is retrieved and how the tweet is composed and sent.
2. Step 2: Choose a suitable public cat picture API (e.g., The Cat API).
3. Step 3: Add a function to fetch a random cat picture URL from the chosen API.
4. Step 4: Implement a random number generator (e.g., `random.randint(1, 10)`) to determine if a cat picture should be posted.
5. Step 5: Modify the tweet composition logic to use the cat picture URL and a suitable caption if the random number generator condition is met.
6. Step 6: Add error handling for the cat picture API call.
7. Step 7: Update `.env.example` to include optional configuration for the cat API (if needed).
8. Step 8: Add documentation to the README.md file describing the new feature and any required configuration.

## Testing Plan
Since the project lacks a formal testing framework, manual testing is required. Run the bot and observe its behavior over a period of time. Verify that the cat pictures are posted approximately 1/10 times and that the Spotify track information is posted the remaining times. Ensure that the bot handles errors from the cat picture API gracefully.

## Complexity Assessment
